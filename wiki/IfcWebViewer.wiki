===How it work?===
IfcWebServer converts the geometry representation of IFC objects into the  open and standard 3D format "COLLADA". The render takes place in the browser with help of the Spider WebGL Java script library (http://spidergl.org/).

You need to have a WebGL enabled browser to be able to use IfcWebViewer  (Google Chrome/Firefox), MS Internet Explorer is NOT supported.

===Since there are enough free IFC viewers available why we need to reinvent the wheel again ?===
We are not trying to create a professional IFC web viewer in any case.Viewing big models online will be always a bottle neck for the performance. but we are trying to create a simple viewer to support the idea behind IfcWebServer (getting information about the building model easily) with features like :
 * show the results of filters/queries directly in the browser for a partial model filters (select/hide operation)
 * change the color of objects according to their properties for example for validation rules.
 * Exchange views between users as links.

IfcWebServer is a web-application, so adding the web browser makes sense as well.

if you need only to view your IFC models using [http://www.ifcwebserver.org/sgl/ IfcWebViewer] without the need to use special features you can convert any model using free tools in easy steps :
 # Open your IFC file with [http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/soft/4926512/ DDS-CAD 7.3] and export it in 3ds format
 # import the 3ds into [http://www.blender.org Blender] and export it again in COLLADA (dae extension)
 # Upload the dae file to the IfcWebServer server the same way you upload IFC files
 # Open IfcWebViewer and select your file from the files drop down list
