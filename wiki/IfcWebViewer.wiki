#summary IfcWebViewer

== Introduction ==

[http://bci52.cib.bau.tu-dresden.de/ifcwebserver/sgl/ IfcWebViewer] is a part of ifcWebServer Project, however it is still in a beta verion.

===Demo Examples===
here are some online examples and screen shots using the ifc file :
*AC10-Institute-Var-1.ifc* :

===How it work?===
IfcWebServer converts the geometry representation of ifc objects into the  open and standard 3D format "COLLADA". The render takes place in the browser with help of a WebGL script library (http://spidergl.org/).

so you need to use a WebGL enabled browser to be able to use IfcWebViewer  (Google Chrome/Firefox), MS Internet Explorer is NOT supportd.

click here to check if your browser supports WebGL : http://get.webgl.org/

===Since there are enough free IFC viewers available why we need to reinvent the wheel again ?===
We are not trying to create a professional ifc web viewer in any case.Viewing big models online will be always a bottle neck for the performance. but we are trying to create a simple viewer to support the idea behind IfcWebServer (getting information about the building model easily) with features like :
 * show the results of filters/queries directly in the browser for a partial model filters (select/hide operation)
 * change the color of objects according to their properties for example for validation rules.
 * Exchange views between users as links.

IfcWebServer is a web-application, so adding the web browser makes sense as well.

At moment the following ifc geometry classes are supported through native Ruby code extensions:
{{{
IfcLine
IfcPolyLine
IfcComposedCurve
IfcTrimmedCurve
IfcRectangleProfile
IfcCircleProfileDef
IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef
IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel
IfcFace
IfcFacedBrep
IfcConnectedFaceSet
IfcClosedShell
IfcFaceOuterBound
IfcBoundingBox
IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel
IfcExtrudeedAreaSolid
IfcGrid
}}}

if you need only to view your ifc models using [http://bci52.cib.bau.tu-dresden.de/ifcwebserver/sgl/ IfcWebViewer]without the need to use special features you can convert any ifc model using free tools in easy steps :
 # Open your ifc file with [http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/soft/4926512/ DDS-CAD 7.3] and export it in 3ds format
 # import the 3ds into [www.blender.org Blender] and export it again in COLLADA (dae extension)
 # Upload your file to the IfcWebServer or to any server around the world.
 # copy the url of your file to the URL input box 
 # Enjoy
